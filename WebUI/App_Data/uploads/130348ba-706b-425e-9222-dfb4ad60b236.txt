1. At the level of perfection where you find god, there is never a moment of dullness
2. Keep your actions as truthful as possible to your intentions. A difference
   in your actions and intentions is waste. The other way to see at the same
   point is, Put your 100% to the task at hand. Whatever you do, do it with all
   your heart.
3. Do not do actions to please or be in somebody's good books. Do it only if
   you believe in it. You can reason and introspect but do not do actions plainly
   for personal gains.
4. The best relationship you can have with anyone is that of friendship. That also includes your relationship with God.

   It means you will remember him not only in pain but also in happiness, and with equal intensity. It means you have un-conditional love for him. Can you be friends    with GOD ?
