Hi,

I have overall 16 years of software development and support experience, out of which 7 years are in project management of digital application development and maintenance projects in varied technologies. However, referring to your requirement,  I do not have local experience. Knowing this fact, I have decided to apply hoping that probably you may consider my candidature based on my experience. I can provide references to validate my experience, in case you want to give me an opportunity. 

I am working as an independent software consultant for past 5 years and have experience in all phases of the SDLC. I am confident that my experience and skills will help me to justify this role. Kindly let me know if you feel the same.

Thanking You,
Regards,

Shweta Patki
